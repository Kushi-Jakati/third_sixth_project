Hi Rob,

When I first started trying to generate runtime errors, the first ones I had in mind was the number inputted in either
the parsed numerator or denominator would exceed the maximum or minimum value that could be stored into an integer. The 
second error I could think of was the user inputting a double, String, special character, or a single integer
(without the format a/b). However, all these errors only threw out ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException because of how I 
parsed user input. Because of that, I ended with a lot of try-catch blocks within try-catch blocks and I didn't know 
the exact run-time error the errors I predicted would actually generate until I went further in the try-catch blocks. 
So I included a document detailing that process rather than a document listing all the errors I thought could occur and their
subsequent exceptions (since all of them fell under the same exception at first). But just in case you wanted all the errors
I thought of before altering the program, I've listed them in this txt document.
